*Read me for Proto2*

The second iteration of the prototype continues to only use the ultrasonic sensor and IMU as the data being used for music play.

In this iteration, the data is not directly mapped to a note, rather the data is compared to a few ranges, and depending on which
range the data is in, a specific note will play.


*Range of data*
In this iteration, the ultrasonic sensor ranges from 3-45cm. The range can ofcourse be altered to be less or more; up to 250cm.

The IMU detects the degrees of rotation in the X,Y and Z axis. 

In the X-axis, the data ranges from 0-315 degrees in 
45 degree increments. The data can of course range from 0-359 degrees, in any chosen increment.

The Y and Z-axis ranges from -180 to 180 degrees in 45 degree increments. Again: this can be changed if so chosen. 


*How to use*
The device is quite simple to use: simply rotate the box in each axis and/or bring an object closer or farther away from the
ultrasonic sensor and listen to the music!

To turn off: touch the pad.
