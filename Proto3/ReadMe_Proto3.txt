*Read me for Proto3*

The third iteration of the prototype makes use of each sensor, inlcuding every touch pad 
as the data being used for music play.

In this iteration, the data is not directly mapped to a note, rather the data is compared to a few ranges/levels,
and depending on which range the data is in, a specific note will play. 

The ranges/levels and specific notes can be altered for higher customizability. 


*Range of data*
In this iteration, the ultrasonic sensor ranges from 3-45cm. The range can ofcourse be altered to be less or more; up to 250cm.

The IMU detects the degrees of rotation in the X,Y and Z axis. 

In the X-axis, the data ranges from 0-315 degrees in 
45 degree increments. The data can of course range from 0-359 degrees, in any chosen increment.

The Y and Z-axis ranges from -180 to 180 degrees in 45 degree increments. Again: this can be changed if so chosen. 


*How to use*
The device is quite simple to use: simply rotate the box in each axis and/or bring an object closer or farther away from the
ultrasonic sensor. Press the three touch pads which are located at front; these will play special sounds!

To turn off: touch the pad located in the back.
