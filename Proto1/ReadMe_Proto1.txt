*Read me for Proto1*

The first iteration of the prototype only uses the ultrasonic sensor and IMU as the data being used for music play.

In this iteration, the data is mapped directly to a note; every single note is used.
PLEASE NOTE: in later iterations, only specific notes will be played allowing for greater customizability.


*Range of data*
In this iteration, the ultrasonic sensor uses its full range: 2-250cm.

The IMU detects the degrees of rotation in the X,Y and Z axis. In the X-axis, the data ranges from 0-359 degrees.
The Y and Z-axis ranges from -180 to 180 degrees.


*How to use*
The device is quite simple to use: simply rotate the box in each axis and/or bring an object closer or farther away from the
ultrasonic sensor and listen to the music!

To turn off: touch the pad.
